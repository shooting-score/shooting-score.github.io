# shooting-score.github.io
A webapp made to work offline in the phone to help count scores during shooting competitions.
## Todo
### Bugfixes
* Correct language for Results-page and CSV-export
* Don't ask to clear all scores on first page load (ignore if maxShots == 0)
* Get offline support for audio files to work (or is it already?)
### New features
* Make a way to show individual shots from Results-page (clicking on a series?)
* Import shooter names from CSV?
* Import weapon class and shooting class so results can be divided into correct classes and sorted on winner
* Add support for special competitions (Revolverligan, Snubby, Nioligan), which has higher scored hits, shoot time reduces score or penalty zones.
